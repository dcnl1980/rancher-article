## Let's start with Docker

Ever had the issue that a piece of code worked perfectly on your dev machine, but your coworkers couldn't run it? Or worse, once pushed to production, you noticed that an elusive library was not compatible with the code you created?

This is the reason why Docker was created! 
Docker is a system that let's you create "containers", aka mini-virtual machines, just from a simple ```Dockerfile```. 

The idea behind a container is simple: create a virtual machine that has only one job (nginx, redis, for example) and that it's replicable with the same environment. Once created, a container will for sure have the same libraries, dependencies, and software version as you intended. 
The end result is that whatever you created while developing is portable (to your coworkers and production!).

The docker world has a few terms that we should get aquainted with:

- **Dockerfile**: this is a simple text file describing how to create an image.
- **Image**: a full copy of the final virtual machine generated by a Dockerfile
- **Container**: a running copy of a docker image


Let's dig down to the code, and it will all make much more sense ;-)

Create a new directory, and open a terminal in it.

Save the following as `Dockerfile`

```
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y php
RUN mkdir -p /var/www

EXPOSE 8999

ENTRYPOINT php -S 0.0.0.0:8999 -t /var/www
```

The file above will:
- use the image "ubuntu", meaning it will download from the Docker Hub an official ubuntu release
- Run apt-get update and install php
- creates a folder /var/www
- Lets the Docker host know that this container will reply to the port 8999
- starts a php self contained server on port 8999 with /var/www as docroot

From the terminal now we can create the docker image, and give it the name "testphp":
```bash
docker build -t testphp .
```


Ready to run your first docker container?

```bash
docker run -d -p 8999:8999 testphp
```

Now if you hit the docker machine ip at the port 8999, you'll see the answer from the php server within the container! Congratulations, you are now able to create docker images!
